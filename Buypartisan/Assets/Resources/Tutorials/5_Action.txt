Every round, each player can purchase an action that will effect the flow of the game.
Each action costs different amounts, and the cost of the action will increase the more the player buys (NEEDS CLARIFICATION!).
Actions include moving voters, moving your own token, increasing or decreasing spheres, and more.
Mouse over an action to see specifics of said action.
