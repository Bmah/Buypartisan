//Coffee Party:  Because of their overly caffinated nature, the coffee party is able to take two actions in
//a single turn without the price of said actions raising.  However, they MUST make at least one action every 
//turn, or two if they are able.

//Republicant party: Discount on shadow position, but decreased sphere of influence on shadow positions.
